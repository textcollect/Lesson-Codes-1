INSERT INTO `` (`idPost`,`postTitle`,`postDescribe`,`postFull`,`postTime`,`user_id`) VALUES (6,'Horror 1','Sample horror story 1','It was a dark and stormy night. Claire, a young woman, was driving home from a late shift at work. The rain was coming down in sheets, making it nearly impossible to see the road ahead. Suddenly, her car hit something in the road, causing her to lose control and spin out.\r\n\r\nClaire\'s heart was pounding as she got out of her car to inspect the damage. That\'s when she saw it: a mangled figure lying in the road. It looked like a person, but there was something off about it. Its limbs were twisted at unnatural angles, and its eyes were open and staring blankly ahead.\r\n\r\nAs Claire approached the figure, she noticed a strange smell coming from it. It was a sickly-sweet odor, like rotting fruit. She gagged and covered her mouth with her hand as she got closer.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the figure sat up and grabbed Claire\'s ankle with a cold, clammy hand. She screamed and tried to pull away, but the figure was surprisingly strong. It pulled her down to the ground and began to crawl on top of her.\r\n\r\nClaire could feel its breath on her face now, and it smelled like death. She closed her eyes and prayed for it to be over quickly.\r\n\r\nBut then, just as suddenly as it had attacked her, the figure let go and slithered away into the darkness. Claire lay on the ground, shaking and crying, until she finally mustered the courage to stand up and run back to her car.\r\n\r\nAs she drove home, her mind was racing with questions. What was that thing? Was it human? And why did it attack her?\r\n\r\nWhen she got home, she tried to put the incident out of her mind and went to bed. But she couldn\'t shake the feeling that something was watching her.\r\n\r\nOver the next few days, Claire began to notice strange things happening around her. Objects would move on their own, doors would slam shut, and she would hear whispering voices coming from empty rooms.\r\n\r\nOne night, she woke up to find the figure from the road standing at the foot of her bed. Its eyes were still blank and lifeless, but it seemed to be studying her. Claire tried to scream, but no sound would come out.\r\n\r\nThe figure reached out a hand and touched her forehead. Claire felt a cold, prickly sensation spread through her body, and then everything went black.\r\n\r\nWhen she woke up, she was lying on the road where she had crashed her car. The rain had stopped, and the sun was just beginning to rise. Claire was confused and disoriented, but as she looked around, she realized that the figure was gone.\r\n\r\nShe stumbled back to her car and drove home, hoping that it had all been a terrible nightmare. But when she got there, she found a note on her kitchen table that read: \"I\'ll be watching you.\"\r\n\r\nClaire never recovered from her ordeal. She moved away and changed her name, but she could never escape the feeling that the figure was still out there, somewhere, watching and waiting.','2023-05-13 21:48:51',2);
