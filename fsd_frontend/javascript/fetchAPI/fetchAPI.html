        /*
        to use fetch method to call an API and return data to display
            - send or receive info
        
        fetch method follows the concept of Promises
        - "Producing code" is code tt can take some time (e.g. calling an API to get the data from the data from the backend)
        
        - "Consuming code" is code tt must wait for the result (e.g. after 5 seconds, server response status code 200, 
            and return the data to the frontend; or return 404/500 error, timeout)
        */



        /* Get data with fetch
        Default http method is GET
        If the request is successful, .then() method will be executed.
        The data returned from the server will be represented by the response parameter
        The response parameter w the data will be in JSON format
        JS has to convert it into a known datatype (e.g. object, array, string, number, boolean)
        Need to use .json() method to take in JSON as input and parse it to produce a JS object 
        
        If there are multiple .then() methods, the return value of the previous .then()
        method will pass into the next .then() method
        
        JSON exists as a string — useful when you want to transmit data across a network. 
        It needs to be converted to a native JavaScript object when you want to access the data.

        Example for below:
        return value of 1st .then() method is data in JSON format
        info will be stored w the data in object format

        fetch("https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1")
            .then(response => response.json())  //arrow fn is used here
            .then(info => {
                console.log(info);

                // Display info on frontend
            });
