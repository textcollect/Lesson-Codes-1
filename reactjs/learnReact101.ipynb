    "\n",
    "Our program will display a selection of animals on the screen. We’ll be allowed to decide if we want to include a background or not. Clicking an animal will cause a fact to be randomly selected from a list of potential options. The selected fact will pop up on the screen. As we keep clicking, we’ll be able to see different facts.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Tasks**\n",
    "**Add a Title**\n",
    "1. On line 1 in app.js, you should see an import statement. This is importing the animals object from animals.js. Feel free to take a look at it now, but we’ll be coming back to it in later tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let’s import the React from react and createRoot from react-dom/client.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Click on index.html to find out the id of the HTML element to get a reference of. Use this id and the document object to get a reference of this element and store it in a constant called container.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create a React root so you can render content using the createRoot() method, passing container as an argument. Store this root in a constant called root.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add a title constant that will hold the value of the title. For now, set its value to an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, create an animalFacts constant to hold the JSX expression that we’ll want to be compiled. Set its value to a <h1> element that contains our title.\n",
    "\n",
    "We still shouldn’t see anything in the browser yet! We’ll have to wait until we write our React root’s render() method before anything shows up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We could fill in the empty string assigned to title if we wanted, but we could also leave it blank and let the JSX use a default value instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the ternary operator, let the <h1> heading use ‘Click an animal for a fun fact’ as the default if title is an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. It’s time to call our root‘s render() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s pass in animalFacts as the JSX expression that we want to be compiled and rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "When finished, click Save. If all goes well, we should see the text ‘Click an animal for a fun fact!’ appear on the screen!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Add a Background**\n",
    "7. Let’s add a background!\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhere above where animalFacts is defined, create a constant named background. Set its value to a <img /> element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s give it some attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Give it a class of 'background'\n",
    "Let’s use 'ocean' for alt.\n",
    "Finally, use '/images/ocean.jpg' as the value of src.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Let’s reformat the JSX expression stored in animalFacts to include the background variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrap the current <h1> element and our new background variable inside of <div></div> tags. Since the expression is going to be multiple lines, wrap it in parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click Save. If everything is working as it should, we should see our background image showing up underneath the title!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Add an Array of Images**\n",
    "9. Use a for...in loop to iterate over the animals object that we’re importing on line 1. Before the animalFacts definition, define an images array. For each animal, add a new <img /> to that array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming animal is the placeholder variable in your for...in loop, each image should have the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "key: {animal}\n",
    "className: 'animal'\n",
    "alt: {animal}\n",
    "src: {animals[animal].image}\n",
    "aria-label: {animal}\n",
    "role: 'button'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Now that we have our array of images, let’s inject it into the JSX expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the animalFacts JSX, underneath {background}, create a <div>. Give it a className attribute and set it equal to 'animals'. Nest the array of images inside of this element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, click Save. We should see our animals!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adding Fun Facts**\n",
    "11. Now that we have our animals displaying on the screen, we’re ready to add an event listener! But first, let’s write a function to handle this event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function displayFact() that takes one parameter e, the event. We want this function to pick a random fun fact based on the selected animal.\n",
    "Inside of the function, use e.target.alt to get the name of the animal being clicked.\n",
    "Generate a random index and use it to access an element in the animal’s .facts array.\n",
    "Save the fun fact in a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. We need a place to display our facts. Create an empty <p> element in animalFacts and give it an id attribute equal to 'fact'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. We’ll need to include the event listener with each <img> and edit the event listener so that it displays the fact in our new <p> element.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the for...in loop, inside each <img>, add an onClick event listener that calls displayFact.\n",
    "Inside displayFact() use document.getElementById('fact') to grab the <p> element where we’ll add our fact. Change the .innerHTML of the <p> element to our randomly selected fact.\n",
    "Now save the code and click on an animal. We should see a fact pop up on the screen!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extra Credit**\n",
    "14. Let’s add one last feature to our awesome app!\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a showBackground constant. You can set its value to either true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "If showBackground is true, background should show up. If it’s false, it should not. Use the && operator in animalFacts to implement this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toggle the value of showBackground between true and false and save the code to see if you got it working!\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional Task: In addition to the AND && operator, we can use the OR || operator. Given a list of variables or expressions, || will return the value of the first one whose boolean evaluates to true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that the boolean of an empty string is false, can you think of a way to use || to replace the ternary operator in the heading?"

    "**Setting Up**\n",
    "1. Click Save to see the current state of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contact info in the browser looks fine, but it should be hidden until you enter a password!\n",
    "\n",
    "Look in Contact.js. You can see a Contact function component. Inside is a function called handleSubmit(), which will be responsible for authorizing the user into the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a lot of logic already here. As we progress, you’ll start learning what useState and such is. For now, just know that you can check whether a user has entered the right password by checking if authorized is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Let’s look at the <h1></h1> tags in the return statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, the <h1> element displays the text Contact. If a user hasn’t been authorized, then you want the <h1> element to display Enter the Password instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using what you know of conditionals in components, make the <h1> element display \"Contact\" only if authorized is true. If authorized is false, then the <h1> element should display \"Enter the Password\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Let’s check to see if that last step is working properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, the browser should say, “Enter the Password”. This is because authorized has the initial value of false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit line 5 so that it has useState(true) instead of useState(false) for now. You should see that the text now says “Contact”. Don’t worry about how useState works—we’ll go over it in a future React lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it works, then make sure to change it back to useState(false) before moving on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Login Form**\n",
    "4. If the user isn’t authorized, then you want them to see a login form into which they can enter a password. Let’s make that login form!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the return statement but after the handleSubmit() function, declare a new variable named login.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set login equal to a JSX <form></form> element. This <form></form> is going to have multiple children, so wrap it in parentheses!\n",
    "\n",
    "Give the <form></form> an attribute of action=\"#\" to make sure it does not redirect.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Great! By saving two JSX expressions as variables, you are ready to toggle between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the component’s return statement, make a new line right below the <h1></h1> element. On this new line, use a ternary operator. If authorized is true, make the ternary return contactInfo. Otherwise, make the ternary return login.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Within the Contact function component, you see a function named handleSubmit().\n",
    "\n",
    "This function will check whether a submitted password is equal to 'swordfish'. If it is, then authorized will become true.\n",

    "#### CodyOverFlow Forum\n",
    "In this project, we will build the beginnings of a web forum! A forum is an online discussion board where users can exchange their opinions on a variety of topics. The most important component of a forum is the comment section. This is what we’ll work on in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "In building this application, you will sharpen your skills in React components by practicing using props as well as defining, rendering, and referencing components.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get stuck during this project or would like to see an experienced developer work through it, click “Get Unstuck“ to see a project walkthrough video.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks**\n",
    "**Setting Up Header and Body**\n",
    "1. Take a look at the files provided for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a file named **commentData.js** which contains an array of comment objects with `profileImg`, `username`, and `comment` as its properties. You will use this to populate the comments on the forum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your comment section will be composed of `Card` components, which will be comprised of smaller `Header` and `Body` child components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, **App.js** will contain the top-level component. The data in **commentData.js** will be retrieved in **App.js** and flow downward from `App` to `Card` to `Header` and `Body`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**index.js** will render the `App` component. **style.css** and **index.html** handle the markup and styling of the forum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you feel comfortable with the structure of this application, move on to the next checkpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Let’s start with the smallest component, the `Body`. The `Body` is responsible for showing the comments that users have written. It will work with the `comment` property of our passed-down `comments` object extracted from **commentData.js**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up **Body.js** and define your `Body` component.\n",
    "\n",
    "This component should receive `props`. This `props` object contains all of the data on our comment, such as the username, profile image, and comment, but the `Body` works specifically with only the `comment` property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have the component return a `<p>` element that contains the `comment` property from `props`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Export the `Body` component after its function definition so that it can be imported and used in **Card.js**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Open **Header.js** and define your `Header` component.\n",
    "\n",
    "This component will be responsible for the `profileImg` and `username` properties of our passed-down `comments` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Header` component should receive `props`. The component should return two elements, an `<img>` element whose `src` attribute will receive the `profileImg` property from `props`, and a `<h1>` element, displaying `username` from `props`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Export the `Header` component after its function definition so that it can be imported and used in **Card.js**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setting Up Card**\n",
    "6. Great job! Let’s take a brief detour back to **App.js**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the `App` component is empty. This is the top-level component and it is responsible for returning the interface to be rendered. In this case, it will be returning an instance of the `Card` component for every comment in **commentData.js**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `App` component body, map over the `comments` array with the argument named `comment` and return an instance of the `Card` component.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each component, give it an attribute named `commentObject` and the value `{comment}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Nice! You’ve set up `App` to pass down information to the `Card` component. Let’s put the pieces together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open **Card.js** and import the `Header` and `Body` components. `Card` will be the outer “shell” that contains our two smaller components: `Card` is the parent, and `Header` and `Body` are the child components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin defining the `Card` component. `Card` should receive `props`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Card should return an instance of the Header component, and an instance of the Body component.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Previously in **App.js**, you’ve passed down a `commentObject` attribute to `Card` which contains an object with three properties (`profileImg`, `username`, and `comment`).\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s time to access those and finally pass them to the children components: `Header` and `Body`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Header` expects two props, `profileImg` and `username`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give the `Header` instance an attribute named `profileImg` and the value of `props.commentObject.profileImg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Next, give the `Header` instance an attribute named `username` and the value of `props.commentObject.username`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. The `Body` instance expects a `comment` prop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give the `Body` instance an attribute named `comment` and the value of `props.commentObject.comment`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Now, export the `Card` component so it can be imported and used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rendering the Application**\n",
    "12. Open up **App.js** again, and import the `Card` component which is now defined and exported.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Then, export the `App` component.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Open up **index.js** and import the `App` component.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "15. As you may recall, **index.js** is largely responsible for only rendering the `App` component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `.createRoot()` to supply a container where you will render the `App` component. Then, use `.render()` to render it into the DOM!\n",
    "\n",

    "##### Objects in State\n",
    "We can also use state with objects. When we work with a set of related variables, it can be very helpful to group them into an object. Let’s look at an example of this in action.\n",
    "```\n",
    "export default function Login() {\n",
    "  const [formState, setFormState] = useState({});\n",
    "  const handleChange = ({ target }) => {\n",
    "    const { name, value } = target;\n",

    "      ...prev,\n",
    "      [name]: value\n",
    "    }));\n",
    "  };\n",
    " \n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <form>\n",
    "      <input\n",
    "        value={formState.firstName}\n",
    "        onChange={handleChange}\n",
    "        name=\"firstName\"\n",
    "        type=\"text\"\n",
    "      />\n",
    "      <input\n",
    "        value={formState.password}\n",
    "        onChange={handleChange}\n",

    "      />\n",
    "    </form>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things to notice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use a state setter callback function to update a state based on the previous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The spread syntax is the same for objects as for arrays: `{ ...oldObject, newKey: newValue }`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We reuse our event handler across multiple inputs by using the input tag’s `name` attribute to identify which input the change event came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, when updating the state with `setFormState()` inside a function component, we do not modify the same object. We must copy over the values from the previous object when setting the next value of a state. Thankfully, the spread syntax makes this super easy to do!\n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime one of the input values is updated, the `handleChange()` function will be called. Inside this event handler, we use object destructuring to unpack the `target` property from our `event` object, then we use object destructuring again to unpack the `name` and `value` properties from the `target` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside our state setter callback function, we wrap our curly brackets in parentheses like so:\n",
    "```\n",
    "setFormState((prev) => ({ ...prev }))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells JavaScript that our curly brackets refer to a new object to be returned. We use `...`, the spread operator, to fill in the corresponding fields from our previous state. Finally, we overwrite the appropriate key with its updated value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you notice the square brackets around the `name`? This Computed Property Name allows us to use the string value stored by the `name` variable as a property key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We’ll use objects with states to build an input form.\n",
    "\n",
    "The local state variable profile and state setter function setProfile are responsible for keeping track of the input values from our users. In our JSX, we are looking up properties stored in the profile object. This throws an error at our first render because we are attempting to get the value of a property from an object that has not been defined yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, initialize profile as an empty object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You should now see the form rendered, but nothing will happen when we type in the input boxes. Our form does not re-render to show the keystrokes yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, add the onChange event listener to our JSX tags to call handleChange() whenever a user types in an input field. This way, we can determine what happens when the user changes the input by typing in the form.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Let’s make our handleChange() function a bit easier to read. Use object destructuring to initialize name and value in a more concise way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. There’s a bug in our code! Have you noticed it? Try typing in one input, then type in a different input. What happens? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time that we call setProfile() in our event handler, we give profile the value of a new object with the name and value of the input that most recently changed, but we lose the values that were stored for inputs with any other name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the spread operator to fix this bug. We want to copy over all of the values from our previous profile object whenever we call our state setter function. Use prevProfile as the argument for our state setter callback function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "#### The Effect Hook\n",
    "##### Why Use useEffect?\n",
    "Before Hooks, function components were only used to accept data in the form of props and return some JSX to be rendered. However, as we learned in the last lesson, the State Hook allows us to manage dynamic data, in the form of component state, within our function components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we’ll use the **Effect Hook** to run some JavaScript code after each render to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- fetch data from a back-end service.\n",
    "- subscribe to a stream of data.\n",
    "- manage timers and intervals.\n",
    "- read from and make changes to the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Components will re-render multiple times throughout their lifetime. These key moments present the perfect opportunity to execute these “side effects”.\n",
    "\n",

    "##### Function Component Effects\n",
    "The Effect Hook tells our component to do something every time it’s rendered (or re-rendered). Combined with states, we can use the Effect Hook to create interesting dynamic changes in our web pages!\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to allow a user to change the title of the web page tab every time they type. We can implement this with the Effect Hook (useEffect()) like so:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    " \n",
    "function PageTitle() {\n",
    "  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n",
    " \n",
    "  useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    document.title = `Hi, ${name}`;\n",
    "  });\n",
    " \n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <div>\n",
    "      <p>Use the input field below to rename this page!</p>\n",
    "      <input onChange={({target}) => setName(target.value)} value={name} type='text' />\n",
    "    </div>\n",
    "  );\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at the above example in more detail. First, we import the Effect Hook from the `'react'` library:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import { useEffect } from 'react';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `useEffect()` function has no return value as the Effect Hook is used to call another function. We pass the callback function, or *effect*, to run after a component renders as the argument of the `useEffect()` function. In our example, the following effect runs after each time the `PageTitle` component renders:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "() => { document.title = `Hi, ${name}`;}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we assign `Hi, ${name}` as the value of `document.title`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `onChange` event listener triggers the `PageTitle` component to be re-rendered every time the user types in the input. Consequently, this triggers `useEffect()` and changes the document’s title.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how we use the current state inside of our effect. Even though our effect is called after the component renders, we still have access to the variables in the scope of our function component! When React renders our component, it will update the DOM as usual, and then run our effect after the DOM has been updated. This happens for every render, including the first and last one.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the Effect Hook, the State Hook, and React from the 'react' library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to import everything in one line.\n",

    "##### Clean Up Effects\n",
    "Some effects require **cleanup**. For example, we might want to add event listeners to some element in the DOM, beyond the JSX in our component. When we add event listeners to the DOM, it is important to remove those event listeners when we are done with them to avoid memory leaks!\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(()=>{\n",
    "  document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);\n",
    "  // Specify how to clean up after the effect:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If our effect didn’t return a *cleanup function*, a new event listener would be added to the DOM’s `document` object every time that our component re-renders. Not only would this cause bugs, but it could cause our application performance to diminish and maybe even crash!\n",
    "\n",
    "Because effects run after every render and not just once, React calls our cleanup function before each re-render and before unmounting to clean up each effect call.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our effect returns a function, then the `useEffect()` Hook always treats that as the cleanup function. React will call this cleanup function before the component re-renders or unmounts.

    "2. Import the useEffect() hook and call it with an effect that adds an event listener for 'mousedown' events on the document object. When a 'mousedown' event occurs anywhere on the document, we want our increment() event handler to be called.\n",

    "##### Control When Effects Are Called\n",
    "The `useEffect()` function calls its first argument (the effect) after each time a component renders. We’ve learned how to return a cleanup function so that we don’t create performance issues and other bugs, but sometimes we want to skip calling our effect on re-renders altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common, when defining function components, to run an effect only when the component mounts (renders the first time), but not when the component re-renders. The Effect Hook makes this very easy for us to do! If we want to only call our effect after the first render, we pass an empty array to `useEffect()` as the second argument. This second argument is called the **dependency array**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dependency array is used to tell the `useEffect()` method when to call our effect and when to skip it. Our effect is always called after the first render but only called again if something in our dependency array has changed values between renders.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will continue to learn more about this second argument over the next few exercises, but for now, we’ll focus on using an empty dependency array to call an effect when a component first mounts, and if a cleanup function is returned by our effect, calling that when the component unmounts.\n",
    "```\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "  alert(\"component rendered for the first time\");\n",
    "  return () => {\n",
    "    alert(\"component is being removed from the DOM\");\n",
    "  };\n",
    "}, []); \n",
    "```\n",
    "Without passing an empty array as the second argument to the `useEffect()` above, those alerts would be displayed before and after every render of our component, which is clearly not when those messages are meant to be displayed. Simply passing `[]` to the `useEffect()` function is enough to configure when the effect and cleanup functions are called!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let’s get started by using the following four functions to advance the number stored in time each second:\n",
    "\n",
    "- useEffect(): the Effect Hook, imported from the ‘react’ library.\n",
    "- JavaScript setInterval() function.\n",
    "- setTime(): our state setter function.\n",
    "- A state setter callback function: used by setTime() to calculate the next value of time based on the previous value of time.\n",
    "- Add an effect that uses the setInterval() function to call setTime() every second (or 1000 ms).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Our time value is updating way too quickly because the Effect Hook calls our effect after every render! Our effect is creating a new interval that updates the value of time each second. We keep adding more and more intervals that keep updating the same time variable. We need to clean up our old intervals before adding new ones!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start by creating a variable, intervalId and assign it to our setInterval() code from the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, below your intervalId declaration, use the return keyword to return a cleanup function. Our cleanup function should use the clearInterval() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. That seems to have solved our way-too-many-intervals-all-updating-the-same-variable bug!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s add an extra variable to our timer and allow the user to type a message while the timer is counting up.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s create a state variable called name with a state setter called setName() to manage the value of the input box. Set the state variable to the initial value of an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Great! Let’s go ahead and put that input tag in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add an <input> element to our JSX. Set its value attribute to our state variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Next, define an event handler function named handleChange(). This event handler will take in the value of the user’s input and update the state variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "handleChange() should use object destructuring on its parameter to take in target and use the state setter setName to set the value of name to target.value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Excellent job! Put that handleChange() event handler to work!\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the onChange event listener to the input tag, setting it to handleChange().\n",
    "\n",
    "Try typing now!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Uh oh. More bugs. Did you notice it yet? Type your full name in the text input field. See how the timer seems to stop counting while you are typing? That’s not what we want!\n",
    "\n",
    "What is going on here? We are creating a new interval after each render, that interval will call our state setter to update time exactly one second after each render. When we type in the input field, our component keeps re-rendering, cleaning up old intervals, and starting new ones… but our state setter never gets called until one second after we are done typing!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s fix this once and for all! We really want to use a single interval. We want that interval to start ticking away after our first render and we want it to be cleaned up after the final render.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, use an empty dependency array!"

    "##### Rules of Hooks\n",
    "There are two main rules to keep in mind when using Hooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Only call Hooks at the top level.\n",
    "2. Only call Hooks from React functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have been practicing with the State Hook and the Effect Hook, we’ve been following these rules with ease, but it is helpful to keep these two rules in mind as you take your new understanding of Hooks out into the wild and begin using more Hooks in your React applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "When React builds the Virtual DOM, the library calls the functions that define our components over and over again as the user interacts with the user interface. React keeps track of the data and functions that we are managing with Hooks based on their order in the function component’s definition. For this reason, we always call our Hooks at the top level; we never call hooks inside of loops, conditions, or nested functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of confusing React with code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "if (userName !== '') {\n",
    "  useEffect(() => {\n",
    "    localStorage.setItem('savedUserName', userName);\n",
    "  });\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can accomplish the same goal while consistently calling our Hook every time:\n",
    "\n",
    "useEffect(() => {\n",
    "  if (userName !== '') {\n",
    "    localStorage.setItem('savedUserName', userName);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, Hooks can only be used in React Functions. We’ve been working with `useState()` and `useEffect()` in *function* components, and this is the most common use. The only other place where Hooks can be used is within custom hooks. Custom Hooks are incredibly useful for organizing and reusing stateful logic between function components."

    "\n",
    "**Instructions**\n",
    "1. At the moment, this code seems to work just fine. There are three different network requests being made in a single effect and lots of different, unrelated data being managed in a single state variable. Let’s get to work breaking these single `useState()` and `useEffect()` calls into separate, simpler hooks. Doing so will make this code easier to understand, build on top of, and reuse as we continue to improve our application!\n",

    "- Use a separate State Hook for `menu`, `newsFeed`, and `friends`.\n",

    "- Simplify our JSX to use these new state variables instead of `data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Promise.all()` was helpful to us when we had all of our data bundled up in a single object. It called all backend services, and when they all sent back responses, we could then call our state setters with the responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are now managing these values separately, we can remove this complexity! In our effect, call the `get()` function three times for the three different data collections that our component wants to render, without using `Promise.all()` any more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now that we have three separate backend calls, let’s continue to separate concerns by splitting each of these into three separate Effect Hooks!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Each `useEffect()` call is working with a corresponding `useState()` call. Let’s reorganize our code to show this relationship more clearly, making the logic easier to read and reuse!\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these three data collections, group the related State Hook and the Effect Hook next to one. This will help to make it clear which Hooks are working together to manage each separate data model."

    "In this lesson, we learned how to write effects that manage timers, manipulate the DOM, and fetch data from a server. With the Effect Hook, we can perform these types of actions in function components with ease!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s review the main concepts from this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can import the `useEffect()` function from the `'react'` library and call it in our function components.\n",
    "    - *Effect* refers to a function that we pass as the first argument of the `useEffect()` function. By default, the Effect Hook calls this effect after each render.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The *cleanup function* is optionally returned by the effect. If the effect does anything that needs to be cleaned up to prevent memory leaks, then the effect returns a cleanup function, then the Effect Hook will call this cleanup function before calling the effect again as well as when the component is being unmounted.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The *dependency array* is the optional second argument that the `useEffect()` function can be called with in order to prevent repeatedly calling the effect when this is not needed. This array should consist of all variables that the effect depends on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Effect Hook is all about scheduling when our effect’s code gets executed. We can use the dependency array to configure when our effect is called in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "|**Dependency Array**\t|**Effect called after first render & ...**|\n",
    "|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|\n",
    "|undefined\t            |every re-render                           |\n",
    "|Empty array\t        |no re-renders                             |\n",
    "|Non-empty array\t    |when any value in the dependency array changes|\n",
    "\n",
    "Hooks gives us the flexibility to organize our code in different ways, grouping related data as well as separating concerns to keep code simple, error-free, reusable, and testable!"

    "Now that we’ve created a container component and separated the logic, we can create a presentational (or stateless) component to render our guinea pig slideshow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presentational component’s only job is to contain JSX. It should be an exported component and should not render itself because a presentational component will always get rendered by a container component.\n",

    "#### Parent/Child and Sibling/Sibling Communication\n",
    "We’ve seen how container components communicate with presentational components by passing their state through props, but how do presentational components communicate changes to the container?\n",
    "\n",
    "One idea would be to update the props directly like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function Presentational(props) {\n",
    "  const buttonClickHandler = () => {\n",
    "    props.isActive = !props.isActive\n",

    "But this would not be correct because components should never directly update their props. Recall that React functional components should be pure functions and updating prop values directly would violate that principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for a presentation (stateless) component to communicate changes to a container (stateful) component, the container component must define and provide a way for the presentational component to communicate with it using a change handler function passed as a prop.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "function Container() {\n",
    "  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);                                \n",

    "    <>\n",
    "      <Presentational active={isActive} toggle={setIsActive}/>\n",
    "      <OtherPresentational active={isActive}/>\n",
    "    </>\n",
    "    );                            \n",

    "function Presentational(props) {\n",
    "  return (\n",
    "    <h1>Engines are {props.active}</h1>\n",
    "    <button onClick={() => props.toggle(!props.active)}>Engine Toggle</button>\n",

    "}\n",
    " \n",
    "function OtherPresentational(props) {\n",
    "  // render...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, `Container` maintains the `isActive` state and passes `setIsActive` to `Presentational` through the `toggle` prop. When `Presentational` needs to communicate a change to the `active` prop, it uses the function passed to it through the `toggle` prop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this pattern also indirectly results in communication between sibling components (components with a common parent), as shown in the example above. When `Presentational` communicates a change through `toggle`, it causes a state update in `Container`, which provides the updated value for `isActive` to both `Presentational` and `OtherPresentational` through the `active` prop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let’s start separating the form rendering logic from `GuineaPigs` component into a new presentational component called `GuineaPigsForm`.\n",

    "#### Review\n",
    "Congrats! You’ve learned your first programming pattern to help organize your React code. You divided a complex React component into a container component and a couple of presentational components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps we took:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identified that the original component needed to be refactored: it handled calculations/logic and presentation/rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created a container component containing all the stateful logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created a function that calls the state setter method provided by `useState()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created and exported presentational components containing only JSX.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imported the presentational components into the container component.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used the presentational components in the return statement of the container component.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Passed state and functions used to change state as props to the rendered presentational components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this programming pattern, the container component does the work of figuring out what to display using state. The presentational component does the work of actually displaying the state through props. If a component does a significant amount of work in both areas, then that’s a sign that you should use this pattern!"

    "### React Styles\n",
    "#### Inline Styles and Style Object Variables\n",
    "There are many different ways to use styles in React. This exercise is focused on two of them: *inline styles* and *style object variables*.\n",
    "\n",
    "An inline style is a style that’s written as an *attribute*, like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<h1 style={{ color: 'red' }}>Hello world</h1>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that it has double curly braces. The outer curly braces are to note that everything between should be read as JavaScript. The *inner* curly braces create a JavaScript object literal.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, using inline styles can quickly become messy if you want to apply more than just a few styles. An alternative is to store a style object in a *variable* and then inject that variable as the value of the `style` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we can initialize an object with properties and values like so:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const darkMode = {\n",
    "  color: 'white',\n",
    "  background: 'black';\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the object can be injected to style a component:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<h1 style={darkMode}>Hello world</h1>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let’s practice styling components using both inline styles and style object variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open **StyleDemo.js**. Starting with inline styling, style the first `<h1>` element inside the `StyleDemo` component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give the `<h1>` element an attribute with the name of `style`. The attribute’s *value* should evaluate to this object:\n",
    "\n",
    "`{ background: 'lightgreen', color: 'darkgreen' }`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, let’s style using a style object variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a new line, declare a new constant named `myStyle`. Set `myStyle` equal to this object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  background: 'lightblue',\n",
    "  color: 'darkblue'\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Style Syntax\n",
    "There are a few things to keep in mind when styling components with JSX.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like how we reference CSS properties in the `style` object of the DOM in JavaScript, we write CSS property names using *camelCase* in React:\n",
    "```\n",
    "const styles = {\n",
    "  marginTop: '20px',\n",
    "  backgroundColor: 'green'\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax comes from a small rule. A hyphen is a reserved operator in JavaScript. If we use `background-color`, the hyphen is then interpreted as a minus sign. Thus, we want to be consistent with the property names in the DOM `style` JavaScript object and use camel case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regular JavaScript, style *values* are almost always strings. Even if a style value is numeric, you usually have to write it as a string so that you can specify a unit. For example, you’d write `'450px'` or `'20%'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you write a style value as a *number*, then the unit `'px'` is assumed. For example, if you want a font size of 30px, you can write:\n",
    "\n",
    "`{ fontSize: 30 }`\n",
    "If you want to use units other than `'px'`, you can use a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "`{ fontSize: \"2em\" }`\n",
    "Specifying the `'px'` unit in a string will still work, although it’s redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few specific styles will *not* automatically fill in the `px` for you. These are styles where you aren’t likely to use `'px'` anyway, so you don’t really have to worry about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open **StyleDemo.js**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find your style object variable, and give it two more properties: a `marginTop` of `'100px'`, and a fontSize of `'50px'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, test out React’s value syntax by changing any property values that end in `'px'` from strings into numbers."

    "#### Multiple Stylesheets\n",
    "While inline styles and style object variables are valid methods of styling in React, it can become organizationally difficult to keep track of the styles being applied as your application grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to make styles modular, organized, and reusable is to create separate stylesheets for each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can import a stylesheet by using the `import` keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import './App.css'`\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we have multiple stylesheets with the same class names, the names can collide and create style conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to prevent this is to use CSS modules. By importing it as a module, the styles will only be available for the component that imported the style. This is done automatically by creating unique class names for each module. This frees us from having to keep track of the class names we’ve used across stylesheets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use CSS modules, we begin by naming our stylesheet in this format, where `fileName` should be replaced with the name of the component you’re styling:\n",
    "\n",
    "`fileName.module.css`\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that the file should be processed as a CSS module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, it must be imported into the file containing our component.\n",
    "\n",
    "`import styles from './fileName.module.css'`\n",
    "\n",
    "From this import, we can see that the `styles` object now holds the class selectors of `fileName.module.css`. To access the selectors, we use the dot notation like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "`<div className={styles.divStyle}></div>`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we apply styles using the `className` attribute rather than `class`. `class` is a reserved JavaScript keyword, so React uses `className` to avoid conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although React does not have an opinion on how styles should be defined, this is the preferred method for styling in React, as it maintains the compositional philosophy of React.\n",

    "Before you go, here’s a recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "- React components can be styled in a number of different ways: inline styling, object variable styling, stylesheets, and CSS modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inline styling can be used to apply styles to a single element. Inline styling can be done by giving the element an attribute named `style` whose value is an object literal surrounded in curly braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1 style={{color: \"red\"}}> Hello, World! </h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "- An object variable can also be used to apply a style to a single element. The syntax is similar to inline styling, but rather than passing an object literal, the name of the variable is passed instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "const myStyle = { color: \"red\" }\n",
    "<h1 style={myStyle}> Hello, World! </h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Style names in React must be in camelCase. For example, `background-color` becomes `backgroundColor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In React, a number style value is automatically interpreted with `px`.\n",

    "### React Forms\n",
    "#### Input onChange\n",
    "Let’s talk about how forms are handled in React.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a regular HTML form, the state of the form is typically managed by the browser. It doesn’t update the server until the user hits submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things work a bit differently in React. In a React form, the state of the form can be managed by the component, and updates are triggered by the `onChange` event. When the user interacts with an input, such as entering or deleting any characters, the `onChange` event fires and updates the component state.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the component to immediately reflect any changes made by the user and update the view accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s dive into how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take a look at the existing code. This is an input form for a newsletter! The form currently only asks for the user’s email address. Under it is some text stating “Current User Input”. We’ll use the space here to see the data the user is entering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, open **Input.js**.\n",
    "\n",
    "View the return statement and try typing into the input field on the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, press Run!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Not much happened! Current User Input in the browser still shows nothing despite there being input! Don’t worry; once `Input` has been set up correctly, then you will be able to see the data received from the <input> element live as you type.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To change our code so that it responds to any changes in the input field, start by listening for a “change” event on the <input> tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give <input> an `onChange` attribute. Set `onChange`‘s *value* equal to `{handleUserInput}`.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Update an Input's Value\n",
    "When a user types in the <input> field, then that will trigger a *change* event, which will call `handleUserInput()`. That’s good!\n",
    "\n",
    "`handleUserInput()` will set `userInput` equal to whatever text is currently in the <input> field. That’s also good!\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s only one problem: you can set `userInput` to whatever you want, but <input>‘s `value` prop will not update.\n",
    "\n",
    "In React, the `value` prop of an input element is used to control the value of the input and keep it in sync with the component’s state. Without setting the `value` prop, changes made to the input would not be reflected in the component’s state, leading to inconsistencies and potential bugs down the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that the input’s value matches the component state, we can set the `value` prop and use the `onChange` event to update the state with the new value. When the state is updated, the component re-renders, and the `value` prop is set to the new value from the component’s state.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the component state the “source of truth” for the input’s value, ensuring that the form data is consistent and can be easily managed and submitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we had a login form with an email and password input, we would set the value prop for both inputs and update the component’s state whenever the user types in a new email or password. This way, the form data is always up to date with the user’s input.\n",

    "\n",
    "This example doesn’t have a server per se, but any time that a user updates <input>, the new text is immediately stored in `Input`'s `state`. We could easily connect that `state` with a server. What matters is that the text is sent somewhere to be stored on every character change.\n",

    "#### Controlled vs Uncontrolled\n",
    "There are two terms that will probably come up when you talk about React forms: **controlled component** and **uncontrolled component**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An *uncontrolled component* is a component that maintains its own internal state. A *controlled component* is a component that does not maintain any internal state. Since a controlled component has no state, it must be *controlled* by someone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a typical <input type='text' /> element. It appears on the screen as a text box. If you need to know what text is currently in the box, then you can ask the <input> element, possibly with some code like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "let input = document.querySelector('input[type=\"text\"]');\n",
    " \n",
    "let typedText = input.value; // input.value will be equal to whatever text is currently in the text box.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing here is that the <input> element *keeps track of* its own text. You can access what its text is at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that <input> keeps track of information makes it an *uncontrolled component*. It maintains its own internal state by remembering data about itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "A controlled component, on the other hand, has no memory. If you ask it for information about itself, then it will have to get that information through `props`. Most React components are *controlled*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In React, when you give an <input> element a `value` attribute, then something strange happens: the <input> element becomes *controlled*. It stops using its internal storage. This is a more “React” way of doing things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in our exercises, the page updated every time we typed into the input. React controlled the input’s value with the state. We’ve been demonstrating the idea of a controlled component all along!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information about controlled and uncontrolled components in the React documentation."

    "#### Review\n",
    "Great work! You just wrote your first React form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a review:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The state of a React form is managed by the component, and updates are triggered by the onChange event.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The onChange event uses an event handler to capture changes and determine what actions to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A React form uses the State hook to store the value of the input field in the component’s state. The state can then be updated with the state setter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- React components can be controlled or uncontrolled. Most React forms are controlled, as they control the input’s value with the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "That marks the end of this lesson! The skills you’ve learned with React forms will be invaluable as you continue to build out more React apps!"
